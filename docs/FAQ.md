## Can I use ZeroSMTP with my own hosting and my own domain?

Yes. ZeroSMTP is an SMTP **relay** — it doesn't care which domain your
hosting or website runs on. Setup is three steps:

1. **Register** a free account at [msgwing.com](https://msgwing.com) and get
   a randomly generated address on the `@msgwing.com` domain.
2. **Configure** that account's SMTP credentials in your app, script,
   website, or hosting panel (server: `mx.msgwing.com`, port `587` with
   STARTTLS or `465` with SSL/TLS).
3. **Send** — your application delivers mail through the relay immediately,
   regardless of your hosting's own domain.

This covers contact forms, password resets, and notifications from any
hosting provider, plus the other use cases in the main
[README](https://github.com/msgwing/ZeroSMTP#quickstart) (apps, scripts, printers, IoT, etc.).

## Will emails be sent from my own domain (e.g. you@yourdomain.com)?

No — by design. Every message is sent **from an `@msgwing.com` address**,
never from your own domain. ZeroSMTP only relays mail through the
`msgwing.com` domain and does not send on behalf of arbitrary sender
domains, mainly for anti-spam and deliverability reasons.

| Your need | Does ZeroSMTP fit? |
| --- | --- |
| Reliable outgoing mail for your app/site (contact forms, password resets, notifications) | ✅ Yes, regardless of your hosting's domain |
| "From" address must show *your* domain | ❌ No — that requires your own dedicated mail server |

## Can I get a custom username instead of the randomly generated one?

Yes. Registration generates a random `@msgwing.com` address by default, but
you can request a specific one (e.g. `you@msgwing.com`):

1. Register an account at [msgwing.com](https://msgwing.com).
2. Email your request to **abuse@msgwing.com** with the username you'd like
   and the address of the account you just registered.
3. Once confirmed, the custom username is set permanently on your account.

## What are the sending limits?

See [Sending limits (rate limiting)](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#sending-limits-rate-limiting)
in the troubleshooting guide.

## Do you offer a paid plan for high-volume/bulk sending?

No. Even as a paid option, we don't support high-volume or bulk sending
(tens/hundreds of thousands of messages per day) — see
[Sending limits](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#sending-limits-rate-limiting). ZeroSMTP
is scoped to transactional email on the shared `msgwing.com` domain, and
that stays true regardless of price.

If you need that kind of volume, use a dedicated bulk-sending platform
instead. [EmailLabs](https://emaillabs.io/) is a Polish provider built for
that use case — a proven solution we can personally vouch for, having used
it while supporting a large banking-sector company, primarily for
marketing and sales email campaigns.

## Can ZeroSMTP receive email too?

No. See [This project cannot receive email](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#this-project-cannot-receive-email)
— ZeroSMTP is outgoing-only.

## My printer/device shows a certificate error — do I need to disable certificate verification?

Sometimes, yes — but only for **specific older devices**, and it's not a
setting we recommend as a general fix.

**Why this happens:** `mx.msgwing.com` uses a standard Let's Encrypt TLS
certificate, which every modern operating system, browser and mail client
trusts without issue. Some older embedded devices — certain printers,
scanners, NAS units — ship with a **fixed, non-updatable root certificate
store** baked into their firmware. If that firmware predates the specific
Let's Encrypt certificate chain currently in use, the device has no way to
recognize it as trustworthy, even though the certificate itself is entirely
valid. A firmware update rarely fixes this on consumer-grade hardware, and
which exact chain gets presented can shift over time as certificate
authorities rotate intermediates — so this isn't necessarily a one-time,
stays-fixed problem for a given device.

**What to do, in order:**
1. First rule out a network or configuration problem rather than assuming
   it's this — see
   [Certificate / TLS verification failed](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#certificate--tls-verification-failed)
   for how to tell the difference.
2. If you've confirmed it's this specific old-firmware limitation, disabling
   the device's own certificate check (often labeled *"Don't verify
   certificate"* / *"Nie weryfikuj certyfikat"*) is the accepted workaround
   **for that device** — see the fully documented
   [Canon Maxify MB2755 case](PRINTERS.md#known-exception-canon-maxify-mb2755)
   for a real example, including how to confirm the root cause yourself.

**What that trade-off actually costs:** with verification disabled, that one
device no longer confirms it's really talking to `mx.msgwing.com` rather
than an on-path attacker on the same network — the session is still
encrypted, just without checking who's on the other end. Only accept that
for the specific device that needs it; leave verification enabled
everywhere else.

## Why is ZeroSMTP free? What's the catch?

There isn't a hidden one — the trade-offs are the ones already documented
on this page: mail always goes out from a shared `@msgwing.com` address,
not your own domain (see above), and sending is rate-limited per account to
keep the shared domain's reputation good for everyone (see
[Sending limits](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#sending-limits-rate-limiting)).

Beyond that, per the [README](https://github.com/msgwing/ZeroSMTP#readme): your data isn't processed for
marketing or resold, and abuse accounts are actively removed to protect
deliverability for everyone else. If your use case needs more than what's
documented here, ask at abuse@msgwing.com rather than assuming it isn't
supported.

## My account was suspended. How do I appeal?

Write to **abuse@msgwing.com** **from the email address the account is
registered to**. Requests sent from any other address are not processed.

This is not a formality. "Please restore this account" is exactly what somebody
who had taken over an account would write, and an appeal arriving from an
unrelated address cannot be tied to the account holder. We also will not name
the registered address in a reply, because that would disclose the account
holder's email to whoever wrote in.

If you no longer have access to the registered address, that is an account
recovery question rather than an appeal, and it is handled separately.

Two things worth knowing before writing:

- Suspensions for third-party blocklist entries are not ours to reverse. Where
  a domain is listed by an independent reputation service, delisting is
  requested from that service, not from us.
- On shared or low-cost web hosting, such a listing is often caused by another
  customer on the same platform rather than by your own site. That case is
  recoverable, but it has to be resolved with the service that published the
  listing.

If the site you are sending for is unrelated to the suspended account, you are
free to register a new account. The [sending limits](#what-are-the-sending-limits)
and the generated `@msgwing.com` sender address apply as usual, as do the same
abuse rules.

## Can you share details about your infrastructure or how deliverability is maintained?

No — see the [Security Policy](https://github.com/msgwing/ZeroSMTP/blob/main/SECURITY.md#infrastructure-and-third-party-integration-inquiries)
for what we do and don't disclose, and why.

## Do you accept third-party plugins, widgets, or scripts on the docs site?

No — see the [Security Policy](https://github.com/msgwing/ZeroSMTP/blob/main/SECURITY.md#infrastructure-and-third-party-integration-inquiries)
for the reasoning.
