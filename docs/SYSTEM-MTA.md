# System-Wide Mail Relay on Debian/Ubuntu (Postfix, msmtp, Exim4)

Everything else in this repo shows how to send mail *from a script or app*.
This page is different: it's for making your **whole Debian/Ubuntu system**
— cron jobs, `mail`/`sendmail`, monitoring tools like Monit/logwatch,
`apt`/`unattended-upgrades` failure notices — relay through ZeroSMTP instead
of trying (and usually failing) to deliver mail directly.

Get your credentials first: register and activate an account at
[msgwing.com](https://msgwing.com), then copy your `@msgwing.com` login and
password.

> **The username and password come from an account, and the account is free.**
> Register at [msgwing.com](https://msgwing.com), activate, and copy the
> generated login and password — they are shown once. Mail leaves from that
> generated `@msgwing.com` address rather than your own domain, and the cap is
> 200 messages a day with no paid tier that lifts it. Both limits are stated
> here rather than discovered later; if either one rules this out for you,
> [the alternatives page](ALTERNATIVES.md) names the tools that do not have
> them.

## Top pick: Postfix (satellite / smarthost mode)

Postfix is Debian's and most Ubuntu servers' default MTA, so this is almost
always the right starting point if Postfix is already installed
(`dpkg -l postfix`).

```bash
sudo apt install -y postfix mailutils libsasl2-modules
```
During install, choose **"Satellite system"** when debconf asks (or run
`sudo dpkg-reconfigure postfix` afterwards to change it) — this tells
Postfix "don't try to deliver mail yourself, send everything to a relay."

Create the credentials file:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd > /dev/null <<'EOF'
[mx.msgwing.com]:587 your-username@msgwing.com:your-password
EOF
sudo chmod 600 /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
```

Before editing `main.cf`, check which lookup table type your system
actually uses — this changed across Debian/Ubuntu releases, and using the
wrong one will make Postfix fail to start:

```bash
postconf default_database_type
```

Add to `/etc/postfix/main.cf` (replace `hash` below with whatever
`default_database_type` printed, e.g. `lmdb` on newer releases):

```ini
relayhost = [mx.msgwing.com]:587
smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
smtp_tls_security_level = encrypt
smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
```

For port 465 (implicit SSL/TLS) instead of 587 (STARTTLS), use
`relayhost = [mx.msgwing.com]:465` and add
`smtp_tls_wrappermode = yes` (port 465 needs TLS immediately, not a
STARTTLS upgrade — `smtp_tls_security_level = encrypt` alone isn't enough
on that port).

Apply and test:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart postfix
echo "Test from Postfix satellite" | mail -s "ZeroSMTP test" you@example.com
tail -f /var/log/mail.log
```

## Making mail leave as your account (sender rewriting)

**Do this before you test.** Without it, Postfix satellite mode sends system
mail as the local user — `root@yourhost`, `pi@raspberrypi` — and the relay
refuses it:

```
553 5.7.1 <root@yourhost>: Sender address rejected: not owned by user
```

That is not an authentication problem; the login succeeded. Mail has to leave
as the account it was sent with, and `cron`, `logwatch`, `unattended-upgrades`,
`systemd` failure mail and `mdadm` all use the local system sender instead.

Two maps are needed, because the envelope sender and the visible `From:` header
are separate things and the relay checks the first one:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/postfix/sender_canonical > /dev/null <<'EOF'
/.+/    your-username@msgwing.com
EOF
sudo tee /etc/postfix/header_from > /dev/null <<'EOF'
/^From:.*/  REPLACE From: your-username@msgwing.com
EOF
sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sender_canonical
```

`header_from` is deliberately **not** run through `postmap` — `regexp:` and
`pcre:` tables are read as plain text and have no `.db` to build.

Add to `/etc/postfix/main.cf`:

```ini
sender_canonical_classes = envelope_sender, header_sender
sender_canonical_maps = regexp:/etc/postfix/sender_canonical
smtp_header_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/header_from
```

Then `sudo systemctl restart postfix`.

Where do replies go? Not to the relay account — set `Reply-To` in whatever
generates the mail, or simply read the mailbox of the address you configured.
The `Reply-To` header is not restricted; only the sender is.

Verify the rewrite actually happened, rather than that the command ran:

```bash
echo test | mail -s "sender test" you@example.com
grep "from=<" /var/log/mail.log | tail -1
```

The `from=<...>` on that line has to be your `@msgwing.com` address. If it
still shows `root@`, the maps are not being applied — check
`postconf sender_canonical_maps` reads back what you wrote.

## Alternative: msmtp (simplest option, no mail queue)

Good if you don't want a full MTA — just a way for `cron`/scripts to send
mail via the standard `sendmail` command.

```bash
sudo apt install -y msmtp msmtp-mta mailutils
```

`/etc/msmtprc` (or `~/.msmtprc` for a single user):

```ini
defaults
tls on
tls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
logfile /var/log/msmtp.log

account zerosmtp
host mx.msgwing.com
port 587
tls_starttls on
auth on
user your-username@msgwing.com
password your-password
from your-username@msgwing.com

account default : zerosmtp
```

For port 465, set `port 465` and `tls_starttls off` (implicit TLS starts
immediately on connect, no STARTTLS upgrade). Restrict permissions since
the password is in plain text: `sudo chmod 600 /etc/msmtprc`.

`msmtp-mta` provides `/usr/sbin/sendmail`, so anything that already calls
`sendmail`/`mail` (cron, logwatch, etc.) picks this up automatically.

**Do not use `ssmtp`** for this — it's unmaintained (orphaned since 2019,
removed from Debian testing in 2024); msmtp is its official replacement.

## Alternative: Exim4 (Debian's classic alternative MTA)

If your system already runs Exim4 instead of Postfix:

```bash
sudo apt install -y exim4
sudo dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config
```

In the wizard, choose **"mail sent by smarthost; no local mail"**, and set
the smarthost to `mx.msgwing.com::587` (the double colon forces that exact
port). Then add credentials:

```bash
sudo tee -a /etc/exim4/passwd.client > /dev/null <<'EOF'
mx.msgwing.com:your-username@msgwing.com:your-password
EOF
sudo chmod 640 /etc/exim4/passwd.client
sudo update-exim4.conf
sudo systemctl restart exim4
```

## Bonus: alert on systemd service failures

Once system mail routes through ZeroSMTP (via the Postfix/msmtp/Exim4 setup
above), you can wire any systemd unit to send an email the moment it fails,
using systemd's own `OnFailure=` directive — no extra monitoring agent
needed.

`/etc/systemd/system/notify-failure@.service` (a reusable template unit):

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Email notification for failed unit %i

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/mail -s "Unit %i failed on %H" you@example.com
```

Then add `OnFailure=` to whichever unit you want watched, e.g.
`/etc/systemd/system/my-backup.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=My backup job
OnFailure=notify-failure@%n.service
```

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Test it by forcing a failure (`sudo systemctl start --job-mode=fail
my-nonexistent.service` or a script that exits non-zero) and confirming the
notification email arrives.

## Automating rollout with Ansible

Rolling this out to more than a handful of servers by hand doesn't scale —
here's a minimal Ansible playbook for the Postfix satellite setup above:

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  become: true
  vars:
    zerosmtp_username: "your-username@msgwing.com"
    # Keep the real password in ansible-vault or your inventory's secrets
    # file — never commit it in plain text alongside the playbook.
    zerosmtp_password: "{{ vault_zerosmtp_password }}"
  tasks:
    - name: Install Postfix and dependencies
      apt:
        name: [postfix, mailutils, libsasl2-modules]
        state: present

    - name: Configure Postfix as a satellite system
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/postfix/main.cf
        regexp: '^relayhost ='
        line: "relayhost = [mx.msgwing.com]:587"
        create: true
      notify: Restart postfix

    - name: Set SASL auth options
      blockinfile:
        path: /etc/postfix/main.cf
        block: |
          smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
          smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
          smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
          smtp_tls_security_level = encrypt
      notify: Restart postfix

    - name: Deploy SASL credentials
      copy:
        content: "[mx.msgwing.com]:587 {{ zerosmtp_username }}:{{ zerosmtp_password }}\n"
        dest: /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
        mode: '0600'
      notify:
        - Postmap sasl_passwd
        - Restart postfix

  handlers:
    - name: Postmap sasl_passwd
      command: postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd

    - name: Restart postfix
      service:
        name: postfix
        state: restarted
```

Run with `ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini zerosmtp-relay.yml --ask-vault-pass`
(or however your vault secret is normally supplied).

## Running Proxmox VE?

The Postfix configuration above is the one to use, but the consequence of
getting it wrong is different: a hypervisor tells you about failed backups and
degraded pools by email and by nothing else, so mail that stops arriving looks
exactly like a system with nothing to report. See
[Proxmox VE email](PROXMOX.md).

## Verifying it works

Use [`check-connection.sh`](https://github.com/msgwing/ZeroSMTP/blob/main/check-connection.sh) first to confirm the
network path to `mx.msgwing.com` is open before debugging the MTA config
itself — see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) if it isn't.
